Everything about computers finds my interest. So I deal with programming in different programming languages, e.g. Shell (bash), C/C++, Python and Web (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) to name a few. In addition, I also try to deal with technology in hardware and software, such as NAS (Network Attached Storage) or Docker. Much remains (unfortunately) only in theory - to implement everything practically, I lack the time.

Recently I've been trying to make the program [SourceMonitor], originally by [Jim Wanner], [Campwood Software LTD], an open source project. Any kind of help is welcome here.
